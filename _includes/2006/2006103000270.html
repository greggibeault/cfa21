Game 6, EXPOS at ROCKIES, Derek Lowe vs. Aaron Small, at Coors Field
So back to Coors it goes, where things can always get wild, and believe me,
this was a WILD one. (It was so wild, in fact, that we unfortunately had a
computer glitch that killed the original game file. So I'm running from the
side notes I have for this recap.) Small, fresh from not being needed in the
past two lopsided games, got the start instead of Scott Elarton, and he was
fairly solid, going five innings and allowing only a first-inning run.
Meanwhile, opposing Lowe was sharp as well, allowing only one run of his own
through his first four frames. But then, in the bottom of the fifth, things
went haywire. Johnny Damon led off with a homer. It's 2-1. Milton Bradley
homered. It's 3-1. Mark Teixeira homered, it's 4-1. By the time this inning
was over, the Rockies had scored nine runs and mounted a 10-1 lead, and
Kerry Wood was in the game in relief. The next two innings were a lot of the
same (18 runs for Colorado from innings 5-7), yada yada yada, the final was
22-5, in the craziest Diamond Mind game I have ever seen. Johnny Damon had
another three-run homer in this one, so he finished the series with four
homers in six games.

WP: Small (1-0). LP: Lowe (1-1).

HR: I can't recall them all, but Damon 2 (4), Bradley (1), Teixeira (3), and
I am fairly certain Bradley was the guy with the two-run homer to score the
final two runs in the fifth. -- Tristan Cockcroft

Editor's note: This is the game where Earl Knipfel kicked his computer and 
lost the game for posterity, but Tristan's notes on the game offer a glimpse. 
Without stats, Tristan autoplayed several results until he got a game with a 
fair amount of runs scored, but consider the below just a placeholder.
