CINCINNATI -- John Messina had a dream. And before a soldout Palace of the Fans, 
where the hot dogs tasted like prime rib and the cotton candy smelled of fresh 
spring air, his dream came true. 

It was the first game in the history of the Curt Flood Association, the Houston 
Astros vs. the Cincinnati Reds, and dignitaries lined the baselines as Messina 
strolled out to the pitcher's mound to deliver the first pitch: it was a 62-mph 
fastball right down the middle; Reds captain Brian Giles caught the ball and had 
Messina autograph it; the crowd roared its approval. It was time to play some baseball. 

Randy Johnson didn't so much stroll out to the mound for the top of the first inning 
as scowl out to the mound. The crowd hollered loudly as the Big Unit tipped his cap 
before the first pitch; he then glanced up into the stands. Who was he acknowledging? 
Perhaps Johnson was simply tipping his caps to the baseball gods for a nice sunny day. 

Tomas Perez stepped in, the first batter in CFA history. He took a fastball down the 
middle and then flied out to right. Andruw Jones grounded out and Matt LeCroy fanned 
to end the first. A simple 1-2-3 inning. Hardly a sign of what turned into a crazy, 
high-powered slugfest. Postgame fireworks weren't even needed; they were plenty in the 
game. 

Cincy's Brian Roberts led off the bottom of the first against Mark Buehrle and drilled 
a single into center field for the first hit in CFA history. Brian Giles singled and 
after David Wright grounded out, Nick Johnson was intentionally walked to bring up Mark 
DeRosa. The Reds' shortstop then put his name into the CFA record -- he crushed a Buehrle 
fastball deep over the left-field fence for a grand slam homer; OK, maybe it wasn't crushed 
... rumors are the 338 sign at the Palace of the Fans may actually be off by 25 feet or so. 

The Astros immediately got three back in the second when Alex Rios bombed a three-run homer 
to deep left. The Reds struck right back with doubles from Roberts and Giles, followed by 
a two-run homer to -- you guessed it -- deep left. 

This game was only beginning. In the bottom of the fourth, DeRosa struck again -- a 
three-run homer that knocked out Buehrle. (He would rather us not list his linescore.) 
DeRosa would come up again with the bases loaded in the fifth, but popped out. 

At this point, the details began to get blurry; perhaps too many hot dogs were consumed. 
Home runs were hit; walks were issued; the Reds entered the top of the ninth with an 18-6 
lead -- and managed to hold on to for an 18-12 win after giving up six runs. 

DeRosa would finish with 7 RBIs; Roberts would go 4-for-6 with four runs, two doubles and 
a homer. Johnson, who never did seem focused, survived six innings for the first win in CFA 
history. Buehrle gave up 11 runs and immediately asked commissioner Messina for an 
investigation into the baseballs and the little red pills he saw DeRosa take before the 
game. 

"There will be no investigation," the commish said after the game. "Fans love offense! Let 
them have their offense." 

********** 

Thanks to Astros co-owners Ethan Goetz and Chris Roy for a fun game (I think I had a little 
more fun than they did). I tried to convince them this game was a tad bit unusual.
